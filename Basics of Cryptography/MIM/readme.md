# MIM demostration using 1 sever vm and 2 client vm

## Steps to follow
first download the server.py file and diffie-hellman program file on server vm

then download the client.py file and diffie-hellman program file on both the clients vm

Now running the client and server .py files from virtual machine (VM), but before that don't forget to change the local ip to the machine ip and then run the server and client program accordingly 

now run diffie-hellman program on all the vm

now let client1 chat with client2

but here actually this is going to happen

client1 ------> server
                server ------> client2
                
client1 <------ server
                server <------ client2              
                
as client 1 message is going to server and then server is sending that message to client2 and vice versa and this server here is the tom (attacker) and client1 and 2 are alice and bob
