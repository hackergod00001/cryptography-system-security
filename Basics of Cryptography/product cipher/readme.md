## Title: 
Design and Implementation of a product cipher using Substitution and Transposition Ciphers.
### Lab Objective :
This lab provides insight into:
- How different types of Substitution Ciphers and Transposition Ciphers like Hill cipher, Verman cipher, Playfair cipher, Vigenere cipher works and their advantages and disadvantages.

### Reference : 
- "Cryptography and Network Security" Atul Kahate
### Pre-requisite : 
- Any Programming language and Knowledge of Ciphering .

## Solution:
we will use
